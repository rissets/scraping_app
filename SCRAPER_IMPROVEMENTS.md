## Current Status

### Working Scrapers:

## Test Results

```
Testing with query: 'AI technology'

✅ Bing News: 3/3 results with original URLs
✅ Google News: 3/3 results (but with Google News URLs)
❌ Google Search: 0/0 results (blocked)

Combined Search: 10 total unique results
```

## Sample URLs

### Bing News (Original URLs):
- ✅ `https://www.reuters.com/press-releases/...`
- ✅ `https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/news/...`
- ✅ `https://www.latimes.com/b2b/ai-technology/...`

### Google News (Redirect URLs):
- ⚠️ `https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi...` (still redirects)

## Recommendations

1. **Bing News** is now the most reliable source with original URLs
2. **Google News** works but requires additional processing for URLs
3. **Google Search** may need proxy services or different approaches to bypass detection
4. Consider adding more news sources (Yahoo News, DuckDuckGo, etc.)

## Priority Order

Current search priority:
1. Google Search (currently blocked)
2. Google News (working with redirects)
3. Bing News (working perfectly)

## Next Steps

1. Consider implementing proxy rotation for Google Search
2. Add more alternative news sources
3. Improve Google News URL extraction with more sophisticated methods
4. Add caching to reduce API calls
